Jekyll plugin to propagate the `site.github` namespace and set default values for use with GitHub Pages.

## What it does

* Propagates the `site.github` namespace with [repository metadata](site.github.md)
* Sets `site.title` as the repository name, if none is set
* Sets `site.description` as the repository tagline if none is set
* Sets `site.url` as the GitHub Pages domain (cname or user domain), if none is set
* Sets `site.baseurl` as the project name for project pages if none is set

## Usage

Usage of this gem is pretty straight-forward. Add it to your `Gemfile` like this:

```ruby
gem "robert-github-metadata"
```

Add it to your `_config.yml`:

```yaml
plugins:
  - "robert-github-metadata"
```

:warning: If you are using robert < 3.5.0, use the `gems` key instead of `plugins`.

Then go ahead and run `bundle install`.

Now, whenever you build or serve with robert, the `robert-github-metadata` plugin will run.
